Welcome to my Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing) project repository where I've developed a chatbot from scratch using Python, NLTK (Natural Language Processing Toolkit), Numpy, and PyTorch. This project encompasses various essential concepts in NLP and aims to create a robust and versatile conversational agent.

## Key Features and Concepts:

- **Tokenization and Stemming:**
  - Implemented tokenization to break down text into meaningful units.
  - Utilized stemming to reduce words to their root form, enhancing language processing efficiency.

- **Neural Networks from Scratch:**
  - Constructed neural networks from the ground up to understand and respond to user inputs effectively.

- **Model Persistence:**
  - Developed a mechanism to save trained models to a file, facilitating easy deployment and reuse for other purposes.

- **JSON Dataset Handling:**
  - Worked with datasets in JSON file format, allowing flexibility in managing and organizing conversational data.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Explored hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance and adapt it to specific use cases.

- **Evaluation and Metrics:**
  - Implemented robust evaluation methods to assess the chatbot's accuracy and effectiveness in different scenarios.

- **Labeling and Tagging:**
  - Dealt with messy data by implementing labeling and tagging strategies, enhancing the model's ability to handle diverse inputs.

## Dependencies:

- Python
- NLTK
- Numpy
- PyTorch

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the notebooks for step-by-step insights into the project.

## Usage:

- Train the chatbot model using your own dataset.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to suit your specific requirements.
